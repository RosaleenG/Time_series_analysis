This project covers time series analysis functions performed on data from smart-meters in London from end of 2011 to 2014. It contains the daily consumption (kWh) averaged over several households in London.

The last timestamp for which consumpton is available is January 31st 2014.

The aim is to build a forecasting model that can predict the consumption for February 2014 (exluding 28th, so from the 1st to the 27th).

Get the data
In a notebook, run:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/london_smartmeter_basic.csv")
to load the dataset.

Get Started
You will need to implement three functions:

preprocess
This takes a dataframe and should return two dataframes: ts (your training data) as well as ts_eval.

ts_eval is the evaluation time series, it contains the list of days you will need to predict consumption for so KATE can evaluate the performance of your model.

In the dataframe provided, there is a column evaluation_set that tells you whether this row is for evaluation or not.

To get all the rows that need to be used for evaluation only, you can use:

df.loc[df.evaluation_set]
train
This takes the ts you have processed previously and trains your model. It should return your trained model.

predict
This takes the model you have trained as well as a test time serie 

This should return y_pred, predictions on the test set.

The recommended way of working on this project is to:


You can test that your functions work in a notebook with the following example:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.zip")
ts, ts_eval = preprocess(df)
model = train(ts)
y_pred = predict(model, ts_eval)
print(y_pred)
